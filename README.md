# Life in Baltimore

# Abstract
Baltimore gives to their citizens the "3-1-1" number: just like 9-1-1, but for non-emergencies requests: A broken streetlamp, potential rats in a place, bulk trash pick up,...
Users can submit a request either by phone, or using the website. Then, all those requests (about 4.08M of them) are freely available, with a lot of metadata (time of opening, time of closing, neighborhood, geolocation,...). We would like to dive into this dataset to better understand what are the main problems in Baltimore. If this analysis is successful and provides meaningful insight, it could be use as a PoC to convince more cities to set this service up and ease the communication between a city and it's inhabitants.
