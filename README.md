# Life in Baltimore

# Abstract
Baltimore gives to their citizens the "3-1-1" number. It works just like 9-1-1, but for non-emergencies requests, such as: a broken streetlamp, presence of rats in a neighbourhood, bulk trash pick up, etc.
Inhabitants can submit their requests either by phone or using the web platform. All those requests ,about 4.08M, are publicly available, with a lot of metadata, including: time of submission, time of closing, neighborhood, geolocation, etc. We would like to dive into this dataset to understand what are the main problems in Baltimore. If this analysis is successful and provides meaningful insights, it could be used as a proof of concept to convince more cities to set this service up and ease the communication between a city and it's inhabitants.
