# Life in New York City

# Abstract
Nowadays many communities in the United States and Canada provide a special telephone number
"3-1-1". It works just like 9-1-1, but for request of non-emergency municipal services,
 such as: a broken streetlamp, presence of rats in a neighbourhood, bulk trash pick up.
Inhabitants can submit their requests either by phone or by using a web platform.

In NYC the service has been introduced in 2003 and became the largest 3-1-1 in operation to date.
All those requests are made publicly available with a lot of information regarding each ticket, such as:
 time of submission, time of closing, neighborhood, geolocation, etc. Through analysis of this data
 we aim to understand what are the main problems in NYC. A success in providing meaningful insights 
 could be used as a proof of concept to convince more cities to set this service up and ease
 the communication between a city and it's inhabitants.
